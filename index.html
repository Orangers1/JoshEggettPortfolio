      <h1>Josh Eggett's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Josh "Orangers" Eggett, a college student looking to enter the world of software development.</p>
      <p>I enjoy trying lots of things, from building desktop applications, to websites, to creating

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a 20-year old developer and student from Utah USA, I first started programming in high school making mods for Minecraft, but fell in love with robotics and C++ while in school competing in the VEX robotics competition. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been programming for about 4-5 years now, and I love learning new things. I placed top 0.13% at the vex world championships in 2022, and first place in the state TSA competition for robotics. 
      </p>
      <p>
      After coding in high school I went to college at the University of Utah, and started learning more about software development best practices and lifecycle. During my time at college I've been learning more about developing as a team and working with others to create software that is not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.
